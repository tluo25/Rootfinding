## <a name = "introduction"></a> Introduction
With the implementation of lambdas in modern C++, it has become easier to perform operations on functions. With this library, we hope to create a library of .h header files to make rootfinding in C++ more simple. 

## <a name = "installation"></a> Installation
There are no special actions needed for installation or compilation. Download the necessary header file for your project and use \#include "\file_name\].hin your .cpp or .h file to use the functions in the header file.
