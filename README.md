## <a name = "introduction"></a> Introduction
With the implementation of lambdas in modern C++, it has become easier to perform operations on functions. With this library, we hope to create a library of .h header files to make rootfinding in C++ more simple and less time-consuming. The .h files included in this library do not have any other dependencies and work on any compilier.

## <a name = "installation"></a> Installation
There are no special actions needed for installation or compilation. Download the desired header file for your project and use 
```cpp 
#include "[file_name].h" 
``` 
in your .cpp or .h file to use the functions in the header file.

### <a name = "steffensen"></a> Steffensen's Method
The basic formula for Steffensen's Method is:

x<sub>n</sub> = x<sub>n-1</sub>

### <a name = "bisection"></a> Bisection Method
The basic formula for the bisection method is:
